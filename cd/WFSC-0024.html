                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wilhelm Furtwängler Society of China expects to release the second society disc - WFSC-002/4 - on 7 April 2022. Eighty years ago today, a series of concerts performed in the Berlin Philharmonic Hall in the midst of war came to a close with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. This unstained rendition is so representative and important in terms of historical significance, documentary value and artistic height that the Society has chosen to present a set of CD recordings (002, 003 and 004) commemorating the eightieth anniversary of Furtwängler's wartime recordings. The discs have been prepared and produced over a long period of time, and we are confident that they will deliver a satisfactory result to every music lover.</p>
                   
                    <div align="center" class="msg_desc">
                        <img style="max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;" src="../images/WFSC-0024_cover.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <p>Fans and music professionals will probably have already noticed from the numbering: this release of the Society discs will contain 3 CDs.</p>
                    <p>CD 1 contains Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, performed by Wilhelm Furtwängler on 22-24 March 1942 conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. For this time, we have also chosen the Soviet-era LP produced in Riga, Latvia, as the master disc.</p>

                    <p>CD 2 contains representative recordings of some orchestral works of the Berlin Philharmonic in terms of historical status, interpretative standard and mastering quality, conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler in the middle and late World War II (1942-1945), including: the Prelude to Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, the Prelude to Tristan und Isolde and Liebestod, Adagio of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, Brahms' Variations on a Theme of Haydn, and the Finale of Symphony No. 1. The master discs for these recordings are from the rare private archives of the highest quality.</p>

                    <p>CD 3 contains artificially ambient stereo reproductions of all the pieces on CD 2 except for the 2nd movement of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7. Curating such a CD is a first for the Society, and even though the concept of artificial stereo is not new to the listener, we are confident that this is a fresh and challenging attempt. It is a shame that Furtwängler, as we all know, did not make any real stereo recordings in time for the commercial stereo era. Although similar 'artificial stereo' releases had been made by various labels, they tended to focus too much on lateral soundstages and instrument placement, resulting in a flawed sound with a distinctly "plastic quality" or heavy "artificial traces". Unlike these releases, the Society has carefully re-mastered some of the recordings with high potential for mastering quality by carefully taking into account the pitch, volume, phase and ideal reverberation of the different instruments, significantly improving the three-dimensionality, spaciousness, width and depth of the recordings themselves, as well as a significant positive improvement in instrument separation. We have also gone some way to alleviating the inevitable in-head effect of mono recordings for headphone users, with less compromise with headphones than with speakers. It is recommended that this attempt be listened to in comparison with CD 2, and the Society expects that the artificial ambient stereo remastering included on CD 3 will make up for some of the Maestro's failure to leave stereo recordings.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society has used professional and precise equipment in the transfer, while the audio has been very carefully restored and remixed and mastered at 24bit 192khz, retaining as much detail as possible and restoring the balance of timbre and volume between the various voices, while removing and adjusting to the maximum extent possible negative elements such as undertones, pinch, noise and distortion.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The booklet for this CD release will continue the Society's philosophy of being rigorous, original and informative. In addition to carefully written essays on the interpretation of the tracks, there will be compilations and translations of exclusive material.</p>
                    
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the pricing of the CD, the WFSC offer an affordable prices of ¥100. Pre-orders will be accepted from 31 March, so watch out for the link posted by the Society's WeChat subscription account.</p>
